# My React CV page

I already have a personal CV webpage, which was created using SASS, Nunjucks and bootstrap. It's design is extracted from a free to use template and altered to my personal taste.
Essentially, there is nothing wrong with that CV page. I just decided to use this as a learning experience and am now in the process of partly re-creating and mostly re-imagining my original CV page from the ground up, using a new tech stack.

## Tech Stack

Sketch was used to create the mockups for the webpage.
So far, the tech stack consists of:

- Node, npm package manager
- ReactJS - functional components with hooks
- Typescript
- Git (obviously)
- CSS
- CSS modules

There are many more technologies which I will try to implement in the future - though there are none set in stone yet.

## Planned updates

- [] Implement translations
- [] CSS variables for colors
- [] Create a menu for mobile
- [] Implement smooth scrolling

## External Packages that are being used

- React-Scroll
