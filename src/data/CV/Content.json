			"skillName": "ANALYTICAL THINKING",
			"skillDescription": "Analyzing and calculating any given situation for its benefits, drawbacks, chances, and risks are second nature to me. I first started developing my analytical thinking when I started climbing over ten years ago. The essence of that sport is to overcome a new problem that is given to you. One wrong movement leads to failure, which is why it is extremely important to understand said problem in and out. This way of thinking was proven to be crucial once again when I delved into the vast world of programming."
		},
		{
			"skillName": "SELF INITIATIVE",
			"skillDescription": "My life philosophy is based on the thought, that any situation can be turned around, not only for the better, but for something excellent. I am well aware that neither excellent situations, nor an excellent outcome will be presented to me on a silver platter. Often the only way they can be achieved is by showing the initiative oneself."
		},
		{
			"skillName": "OPEN COMMUNICATION",
			"skillDescription": "There’s almost nothing I value more than open communication, as it is the building foundation of any good team. I strongly believe that good work is only possible if there is a team climate that enables, and encourages everybody to speak their minds. It is equally important to stand by your ideas, as it is to truly listen to others and let them influence, or even change your opinion and mindset."
